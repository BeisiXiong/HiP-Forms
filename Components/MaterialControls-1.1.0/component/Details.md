# Material Design Controls For Xamarin iOS

In 2014, Google published the [Google Material Design](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) with a goal to provide guidelines for good design and beautiful UI across all device form factors.

For Android, developers can use default Android controls.

For iOS, [FPT Software](http://www.fpt-software.com/) built those controls to bring Google material design to iOS application. This is the most complete material design controls for iOS so far.
